# Calciumtrace
Minimal notebooks and scripts for calculating DF/F0 and plotting 2p calcium traces processed in Suite2p with matplotlib or live with plotly for browsing data. Data available upon request.

Very much a work in progress.

Calcium traces can be produced using the `calcium.ipynb` notebooks. SNR data is plotted using the `dataplots.ipynb` notebooks. Data should be placed in a directory named `data` in the same folder as the notebooks.
